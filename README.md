# SwiftUmka

Swift wrapper around Umka (https://github.com/vtereshkov/umka-lang)

- Work-in-progress but most of the api is exposed. 
- See UmkaTests.swift for basic usage.
- Some convinience methods have been added to convert ptrVal to string and structs, though both are "unsafe"
- Clone and `git submodule update --init --recursive`
